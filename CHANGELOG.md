# Pony ORM Release 0.5.1 (2014-07-11)

## Changes/features:

Before this release, if a text attribute was defined without the max length specified (e.g. `name = Required(unicode)`), Pony set the maximum length equal to 200 and used SQL type `VARCHAR(200)`. Actually, PostgreSQL and SQLite do not require specifying the maximum length for strings. Starting with this release such text attributes are declared as `TEXT` in SQLite and PostgreSQL. In these DBMSes, the `TEXT` datatype has the same performance as `VARCHAR(N)` and doesn't have arbitrary length restrictions.

For other DBMSes default varchar limit was increased up to 255 in MySQL and to 1000 in Oracle.

## Bugfixes:

* Correct parsing of datetime values with T separator between date and time
* Entity.delete() bug fixed
* Lazy attribute loading bug fixed
